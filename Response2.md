	For this project, I used ArcMap to incorporate 2010 United States census data into a map of Richmond, Virginia, to reveal some interesting results pertaining to the living areas of African Americans. 
	First, I gathered a georeferenced map of the city of Richmond. Georeferencing is the process of “developing a digitally-formatted replica of the primary source material  that can then be manipulated or combined with other sources using a variety of technical tools,” (Shnayder). In my case, the digitally-formatted replica would be the modern Richmond map, the other sources being the US 2010 census data, and the technical tool I used was ArcMap. After I uploaded everything to ArcMap, I fit it to the display, changed the transparency to make both maps possible to read at the same time, incorporated statistics of black Americans living in certain areas in the city, and created a legend from this information. The map I am referring to is imaged below this writing piece. After finalizing my map, I was able to use the information from University of Richmond’s Digital Scholarship Lab’s “Mapping Inequality” (Univ. Richmond, Digital Scholarship Lab) piece on the living areas of the city of richmond. 
	From this information, I was able to gather many different conclusions about my map. One of the things “Mapping Inequality” provides for us is the quality of living in certain areas of the city. For instance, when I compare and contrast my map with the redlining one, I am able to conclude that majority of black citizens are living in lower security-grade level areas. They are all living in areas near the downtown area marked as either “hazardous” or “definitely declining”, whereas majority of the white citizens live in areas marked as “best” or “still desirable”. Considering slavery and our racial history, these results do not surprise me. However, I find it interesting that even today, we have similar living situations for the citizens in Richmond compared to the early 1900s. This makes me question what caused that to stay relatively the same and to not allow for change. Even though some downtown areas in certain cities are being filled back up by young wealthy couples, the majority of black citizens in most cities still live in the bottom two security-grade level areas. 
	These are the exact type of questions my map proposes, as Richard White was discussing in “What is Spatial History?”. To be more clear, one of the first questions that came to mind for me was the reasons, besides racial issues, caused these living situations to be like this. Looking at this map also makes me question as to why in the past downtown areas have always been inhabited by lower-income minority groups. Did this have something to do with proximity to work, or maybe just that the housing was cheaper. But then that makes me ask why was the housing made cheaper in that location in the first place, why not further out? One question about the present that this map raises is why are the downtown areas now a more desirable residing place for young wealthy couples, considering the history of its living situation. The answers to a lot of these questions are race related but their is some other knowledge as well that this is pointing out. 
	Now I would like to discuss some of the limitations of mapping. According to Jeremy Crampton, one of the drawbacks is the “sense of mapping as unseemly or unwelcome…assumed as a given by a surprisingly large segment of people” (Crampton, page 6). This is most certainly a constraint. These maps point out a lot of worthy information that other sources are not able to find. When people are daunted by the confusing look and unfamiliarity of a map, they think they will not understand it or will just not want to bother with it and thus miss out of this crucial information. For instance, looking at my map, it looks very confusing. There are two maps over laying each other, districts of the city outlined and colored, streets labeled, and a legend with large statistics. There is a lot going on and, at first glance, it does not look easily understood at all. I understand why this happens, but people must get over this initial reluctancy to work with maps and realize that they are not has difficult to work with as one may think, and can provide extremely beneficial information.
