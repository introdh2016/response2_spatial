## Spatial Analysis Response

The redlining maps created by the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) helped define and institutionalize racism and segregation in the U.S. government and in the banks. The HOLC was created in response to the Great Depression, and graded neighborhoods in order to determine which were most likely to pay loans back, and were therefore a better real estate investment for banks. The grading scale went from A/Green to D/Red with A being the most desirable, and D being the most risky investment (Hillier).

The strict criteria for grading neighborhoods left little room for interpretation, and in diverse and multicultural cities like New Orleans this led to desirable and popular neighborhoods getting poor ratings. In the 1938 HOLC map, almost the entire city is covered in shades of yellow and red.

The neighborhoods that are green and blue are in Uptown near Tulane where this is slightly room for growth, and a population of predominately white people. There is also a fair amount of green towards the lake and over in Metairie. These areas are indicative of the suburbanization that began in the 20th century as white populations moved away from the center of the city and out towards the now drained swampland by the lake. 

In order to compare the HOLC map to current census data in the Geographic Information System (GIS) , it was first necessary to upload both a current map of the city and HOLC map to the program. Then, in order to align the maps, one had to pin the HOLC map to the modern map so that they are spatially aligned. This can be a long process, and it takes a lot of pins to get the map to be precise. After that, the 2010 census data needed to be imported in order for there to be comparisons between the HOLC map and the census information. The census data was able to tell you what race was living where and the correlating percentages. It was then necessary to specify what population you were looking at, like percentages of white or black residents in the city. Then it was possible to compare the HOLC map to current population locations.

The most basic and easily fixed issues are the more *aesthetic* issues like the appearance of color in the map overlays and actually being able to line up the maps, and remembering to change the key titles. The HOLC map is divided by different colored regions, and it can be hard to visually compare it with census data if the colors for the census data arenâ€™t complimentary. In the first map below, it is easier to see the colors, but hard to see the map.

The next map is easier to read with better colors and a closer view of the city:

Another issue with these particular maps is the inability to account for fluctuations in population, environmental disasters, or economic downturns between the 1930s and the 2010s. Since this case  only uses two maps and census data from only one period in time, there is no way to track movements in populations and neighborhoods across time. It also cannot account for recent trends, like the gentrification of neighborhoods like the Marigny. 

And because the HOLC map did not cover the entire area of the city and the surrounding suburbs, it is hard to compare the data from then and now given the HOLC neglected large portions of the city while the census covered all of it. In the below map, where the colors are similar to that of the HOLC map but its meaning different, one can see all the areas not covered by the HOLC map versus the information we have today.

While if you compare the two maps for black people (1) and white people (2), the populations seem to line up with the neighborhood grades given by the HOLC.

But, as noted in Bodenhamer, space is always being constructed and redefined by the people in it and around it. Because space is constantly being redefined, it is impossible to capture all the nuances of a city and its residents in two maps (Bodenhamer). Maps are inherently political, as stated by Crampton, and the HOLC map and the census data are also government interpretations of neighborhoods based on certain criteria (Crampton). A deep map would potentially allow for exploration beyond how the government saw the property and the people living there and look at the history of neighborhoods, the growth and decline in areas, or the actual property values. Instead of seeing how the government defined the city, there is an opportunity to see how the people saw and negotiated space. This even happens in the HOLC map, with surveyors commenting on how the French Quarter, while considered "undesirable" by the government, was a thriving historic neighborhood that still had high property values. There is a lot of potential to turn these two maps and the census information into something greater, more complex, and more nuanced so that a reader can better understand the city of New Orleans and its people from the city's own perspective, rather than strict goverment criteria.
