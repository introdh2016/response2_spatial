What I accomplished by completing this project was georeferencing a map of Essex County from 1934 simultaneously with a map from the 2010 New Jersey consensus. I used the data embedded in the map to represent how the white population was spread throughout New Jersey. 
The first step in the process of building our map was to upload the geographic data from the box website. Once both the maps were located in ArcMap, I made the consensus map 35 percent transparent so comparing the two maps visually would be an easier process. Being able to see the distribution of the white population in New Jersey gave me a much better sense of what the “typical” or “average” person is likely to be in each area of the state. After making sure the maps were layered correctly and adjusting the properties of each of them using the arcmap toolbox, I added a legend that specified exactly how the white population was dispersed matching a shade of red with a specific white percentage of the total population. I was able to display this information by going to the symbology section of properties of the consensus map, changing the category to white, and setting the number of buckets, or different percentage ranges, to 10. 
In area A30 of our map of Essex county from “Mapping Inequality” it was given an “A” grade, meaning it was designated as a socioeconomically prosperous area. After analyzing the area description, I was able to infer that it was defined as a white collar town where the estimated income was $5,000 to $50,000+. Additionally, I noticed that the African American population in this area in 1934 was 0 percent. Comparing that info that I extrapolated from the “Mapping Inequality” database with the information that was shown by the map of the 2010 consensus, I was able to discern that not at that much changed in terms of the demographics of this area from 1934-2010. The same area that was designated A30 in mapping inequality was one of the most densely populated areas for the white population. The fact that these two sets of information matches up gives the observer the sense that demographic features tend to remain steady over time in economically successful areas. If I had to guess why this is the case, I would say that residents of said areas see no reason to expand outside of their community or encourage people outside of their demographic to move to their community because they do not want to disturb the balance of their society that seems to be working well for them. 
	A conceptual focus on space and a reliance on digital history are two of the vital criteria of defining spatial history for Richard White. I saw aspects of both of these things throughout the completion of this project. I think because our map has data from two completely different time periods of our civilization, it raises questions that have to do with the development and concentration of certain demographics over the period of about 75 years. An example of one of these questions could be, how has the distribution of the white population in Essex county changed from 1934 to 2010? Or what inferences can we make about why there has been a major demographic shift in certain areas of Essex county? What could be the potential causes of something like this occurring?
	According to Bodenhamer, the challenge of spatial analysis is using “geospatial technologies to probe, explore, challenge, and complicate-in sum, to allow us to see, experience, and understand human behavior in all its complexity and to view its deep contingency. In the case of this project, I think we did what Bodenhamer suggested to a certain extent because we were able to draw conclusions about why demographics in certain areas of our hometowns are made up the way they are. We talked about how redlining was a process that shaped the way certain populations are scattered throughout the areas we analyzed. Bodenhamer also points out that there is tension when it comes to “linking a positivist technology with predominantly humanist traditions”, which is what is being done in geospatial analysis. This is interesting because if we were to analyze the maps we created from a humanist perspective, we might have respect for the fact that there are indeed exceptions and a certain level of ambiguity to what we are saying about the society. However, GIS allows us to break it down into very specific data, where we can analyze exactly how many exceptions there are and where they occur. This is when the clash between the two perspectives becomes apparent. 
	Crampton mentions that there is often a tie between mapping/GIS and racist or discriminatory practices (such as redlining). He explores the argument that yes, these things exist as a result of mapping, however it can be used for both good and bad. Our project was an instance of mapping technology being used for good. We all were able to gain a better understanding of how the demographic was shaped in the areas we live.
