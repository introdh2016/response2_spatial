#Redlining and Baltimore
##GIS with ArcMaps
GIS (geographical information system) programs are something that I was completely unfamiliar with prior to this section in our class. Throughout certain classes, we had discussed the significance of maps and how their composition was constructed and assigned particular meanings. However, the idea of constructing and presenting spatial of geographical data for analysis never occurred to me as a possibility for a field of study in itself. Our introduction to GIS was through our work with HOLC (Home Owner’s Loan Corporation) maps from 1939 and how their significance might be questioned when looking at census tracts from 2010. After loading the data for both the census tracts and the HOLC map on to ArcMap, we had to then align the maps. This meant setting enough control points, which essentially regulate the spatial referencing for the system, and georectifying the maps in order to properly assess what the census tracts and the HOLC map revealed about each other. Jeremy Crampton states, “mapping as a discipline and as a practice failed to establish a rigid separation from art, nor did it ever become post-political” (3). But, we have noted through our readings that maps are inextricably linked to power structures and power dynamics. By playing with the symbology function of ArcMap, we attempted to see how the data from the census tracts complicates the racial divisions of space represented by redlining maps.

##Breaking Down Baltimore
Though I am from DC, I chose to do an analysis of Baltimore for two main reasons: One, 1939 DC was a geographically different place than 2010 DC; Two, I have some familiarity with the conditions in Baltimore through my biological father’s side of the family. Observing the HOLC map may visually lead someone to make one of two assumptions, if we understand the relation between the colored grading system and race: either Baltimore, in 1939, had a very small black population or its black population was restricted to a marginal areas of the city spatially. Due to the history of segregation and white flight in Baltimore, along with the fact that areas graded “C” and “D” constituted the “inner city,” I would be inclined to argue the latter. Crampton states,
###“Critique has a number of basic principle. First, it examines the (often unexamined) grounds of our decision-making knowledges; second, it situates knowledge in specific historical periods and geographical spaces (rather than being universal for all time); third, it seeks to uncover the relationship between power and knowledge; and fourth it resists, challenges, and sometimes overthrows our categories of thought” (16).
A number of these principle cannot be fully addressed without further contextualizing the spatial movement and areas occupied by black people in Baltimore. But, the data–as it is presented–allows for critique in the sense of the fourth principle. If, HOLC maps are implied have effects on the probability of loans being granted predicated on racially divided areas, then what is the significance of black citizens living in areas across the grading spectrum, from A- D? If the “infiltration of Negro[es]” correlated to areas marked “Hazardous” and not those marked “Still Desirable” or higher, then what lead to black people living in these areas based upon the 2010 census tract data?

##Deepening the Story
Baltimore is a city that is disproportionately cared for, I have witnessed the quick transition from developed areas and glamorous tourist attractions to struggling projects troubled by foreclosure and impoverishment. An article on Slate, “Baltimore’s Failure is Rooted in Decisions that Were Made 100 Years Ago,” discusses how heavily the population and prosperity of Baltimore is influenced by the legacy of segregation in the city: “White flight means a smaller tax base and fewer resources for improvement; industrial collapse means fewer jobs; crack and violence means a generation of ‘missing’ black men, in jail or in the ground; a culture of police violence means constant tension with the policed.” The movement of the black population is more complicated than these two data sets alone lead us to realize, but they do draw questions that make that fact more apparent. Another factor worth considering that might further complicate the data is gentrification. Governing.com defines gentrification as when “lower-income Census tracts experience significant growth in both home values and educational attainment.” The movement of wealth is typically linked to race in America, meaning that it can be assumed that the areas gentrified also experienced an increase in its white population. My data led me to analyze that D5 and D2, which were marked hazardous because of the “infiltration of Negro[es],” were now majority white areas. Not too surprisingly, the gentrification map on their site links up with that transition. There are numerous factors that are needed to deepen the analysis of space in Baltimore. The problems of Baltimore are rooted in racial separation spatially and I think there is worth using GIS to include more census tracts over years to question the significance of Baltimore’s 65 percent Black population in 2000, its precipitating factors, and how it has evolved since.
