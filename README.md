 # Spatial Assignment 

Part 1: Your Map

Build your map in ArcGIS. It should be georectified and include contemproary census data. The maps you design should be
included in your paper.

Part 2: Paper

The 500-1500 word paper should address the following:

- Discuss the process of georefencing and building your map. 
- Assuming the reader is unfamiliar, contextualize and develop some initial arguments about your map. For example, you might pick a contemproary census tract using your map and compare/contrast with redlining from [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/36.71/-96.93&opacity=0.8).
- As Richard White states, "visualization and spatial history are not about producing illustrations or maps to communicate things that you have discovered by other means. It is a means of doing research; it generates questions that might otherwise go unasked, it reveals historical relations that might otherwise go unnoticed, and it undermines, or substantiates, stories upon which our versions of the past" (White, What is Spatial History?, 2010). What questions does your map generate about the past and the present?
- Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas (ex. "deep maps") outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of spatial analysis as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?
